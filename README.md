# HexClock
Tightest HexClock Ever

A clock that displays the current time and the colour represented in hex by those digits.

Check out the original [here](http://www.jacopocolo.com/hexclock/)

Ultimate goal is to get this tweetable, 8 characters left.

The repo contains a history of previous attempts to document our progression.

Rules are that we have to keep it just as the original is, minus the weird centreing. 

Update: Recently it seems that the clock breaks in Chrome, need to look into why this is.
