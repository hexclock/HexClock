# HexClock

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hexclock/HexClock.svg?branch=ci)](https://travis-ci.org/hexclock/HexClock)

A clock that displays the current time and the colour represented in hex by those digits.
Check out the original [here](http://www.jacopocolo.com/hexclock/)

Ultimate goal is to get this tweetable, 5 characters left.
The repo contains a history of previous attempts to document our progression.
The rules are that we have to keep it just as the original is, minus the weird centering.

At the moment OSX users will have to install Lato to maintain compatability.

The current best effort is available [here](https://hexclock.github.io/HexClock/143.html)
